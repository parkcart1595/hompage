## Image Guidelines:

- Use high-quality images
- Ensure good lighting and composition
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 1MB each)
- Use consistent aspect ratios for project images
- Consider using placeholder images from sites like Unsplash or Pexels if you don't have project images yet

## Placeholder Images:

If you need placeholder images while setting up, you can use:
- https://via.placeholder.com/300x300 for profile image
- https://via.placeholder.com/400x300 for project images

Replace these with your actual images once you have them ready.
